# Falling Circle *(aka FALLDOWN)*

### About

My very first game ever written.  
It was made in 1-20 May 2012, just before my middle school exams.  
Version 1.5 (2013-07-10). Compiled EXE is included.  

Written and compiled using **Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System 7.1**.  
You can obtain it here:  
<http://deger.republika.pl/Download_MS_Basic_versions.htm#basiccompiler>  

This also could be compiled using **FreeBASIC** (www.freebasic.net) or **QB64** (www.qb64.net), after some small code improvements. Also must work in **QuickBasic 4.5**, I believe. Other compilers were not tested, but may also work.

It's recommended to play this under **DOSBox** (www.dosbox.com) due to timing issues on **NTVDM** (and absence of NTVDM on any Windows, newer than XP, lol).

### Description

It's a simple timekiller.  
Your task is to fly a ball into the gaps in walls that are moving to the top of the screen. If the ball flew into the top edge of the screen – you lose.  
Every wall you've passed will give you 10 points.  

After every 50 points the speed of walls movement increases. After every 700 points the speed is reset, but acceleration increases.

After first 500 points bonuses become available. They're appear randomly.  
There is 3 kind of bonuses:  
***CRAZY KARATE*** – the ball will break through the walls with enormous speed.  
***SCHUMA COCKTAIL*** – the ball will fall through the space like Schumacher (hence the name).  
***SLOWPOKE'S TABLET*** – this reduces current speed of walls movement.  

Use Left/Right arrow keys to control the ball.  
Hall Of Fame (score table) and debug mode with cheats (sic!) are also available. See sources and you will succeed.

Have fun! (if anyone ever cares, lol)
