# Shunting-Yard Algorithm (simple version)

### Description

It's a simple implementation of the shunting-yard algorithm.  
It reads expression from the `input.txt`, evaluates it and prints result step-by-step.  

That it supports:  
* Numbers in decimal notation (dot `.` should be used as decimal separator).  
* Basic arithmetic operations (addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`).  
* Precedence of operations (using parentheses: `(` and `)`).  
* Automatically skipping whitespace.  
* Reporting errors in the expression.  
* Maybe something else that I have forgot.
